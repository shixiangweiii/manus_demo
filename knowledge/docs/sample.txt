Manus AI Agent Architecture Overview

Manus is a general-purpose AI agent that bridges the gap between thought and action.
It operates through a multi-agent architecture where specialized agents collaborate
to solve complex tasks autonomously.

Core Design Principles:
1. Plan-and-Execute: Tasks are first decomposed into structured plans with clear steps
   before any execution begins. This ensures systematic progress and allows for
   dynamic re-planning when unexpected situations arise.

2. ReAct (Reasoning + Acting): During execution, the agent follows a
   Thought-Action-Observation loop. It first reasons about the current situation,
   then takes an action (using tools), and finally observes the result before
   deciding the next step.

3. Multi-Agent Coordination: Different specialized agents handle different aspects:
   - Planner Agent: Decomposes high-level tasks into executable steps
   - Executor Agent: Carries out individual steps using available tools
   - Reflector Agent: Validates results and provides quality feedback
   - Orchestrator Agent: Coordinates the overall workflow

Memory System:
- Short-term Memory: Maintains recent conversation context using a sliding window
  approach. This provides immediate context for ongoing interactions.
- Long-term Memory: Persists task summaries and learnings across sessions. Enables
  the agent to recall past experiences and avoid repeating mistakes.

Context Management:
When conversation history grows too long, the context manager automatically
compresses older messages into concise summaries using the LLM itself. This
preserves important information while staying within token limits.

Knowledge Retrieval:
The agent can access a knowledge base of documents to inform its planning and
execution. Documents are indexed and retrieved based on relevance to the current
task, providing domain-specific context.

Tool System:
Agents can interact with the external world through a pluggable tool system:
- Web Search: Query information from the internet
- Code Execution: Run Python code to perform computations
- File Operations: Read and write files for data processing

The tool system uses OpenAI-compatible function calling, allowing the LLM to
naturally select and invoke tools as part of its reasoning process.

Reflection and Verification:
After task execution, a dedicated reflection step evaluates the quality of
results. If the outcome doesn't meet standards, the system can trigger
re-planning with specific feedback, creating a self-improving loop.
